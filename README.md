<strong>My-Portfolio</strong>

I created this online portfolio to display my knowledge in web development. This website is a react app using Material-UI hosted on GitHub, serving as a homepage to my projects. 
I started this project multiple times testing different styling frameworks before deciding to use Material-UI, after which I moved forward with this site until completion. 
This project also served as my introduction to Material-UI and deploying a site.
